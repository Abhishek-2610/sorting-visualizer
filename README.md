# sorting-visualizer
Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work. The application visualizes the process of sorting an array using various popular sorting algorithms, providing a step-by-step graphical representation of the operations performed by each algorithm.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
Customizable Array Size: Adjust the size of the array to be sorted, with a range from 2 to 100 elements.
Interactive Controls: Start, pause, and reset the visualization at any time. Adjust the speed of the visualization to see the algorithms in action at different paces.
Detailed Steps: Watch each step of the sorting process, with visual cues indicating comparisons, swaps, and sorted sections of the array.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface designed for ease of use and better understanding.
